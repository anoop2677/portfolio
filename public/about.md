# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 2012 when I was 18. It was an Customized 2nd hand desktop that ran window XP. My favorite games were GTA, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. Still don;t know why but mini games were more exciting.

- At 20, My second year of college, I got my first laptop in which I tried building my first tic-tac-toe game using java, building it was the motivation factor.

- After that created my first static [website](https://github.com/anoop2677/mySite).

- Got more interested in the back end technologies, the logic parts behind every actions, started developing API's.

- Just started to make history.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
