Still don;t know why but mini games were more exciting.\n\n- At 20, My second year of college, I got my first laptop in which I tried building my first tic-tac-toe game using java, building it was the motivation factor.\n\n- After that created my first static [website](https://github.com/anoop2677/mySite).\n\n- Got more interested in the back end technologies, the logic parts behind every actions, started developing API's.\n\n- Just started to make history.\n\nYou can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Skiing\n- Trekking\n- Watching Anime\n- K-Drama\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.
